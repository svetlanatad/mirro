Mirro first is in his house, needs to help mom with house tasks, and then he goes in his room and finds out that that he sees reflections of himself on the walls, he gets shocked, asks his mom if she sees them, she says no, then he goes outside the city and his reflection is following him across the ground and he asks everyone if anyone sees it and nobody does, then he gets discouraged, sits near walls, and an old man comes up to him and says "I see your reflection, ddo you see mine?" And then they get surprised since they see each other's reflections, and the old man goes like "my grandpa always used to tell this, that in this world, the reason there are no mirrors is because people stopped differentiating the evil and the good in themselves, they merged into one, and live as if there is no evil or no good in this world. and yet if a little special someone sees their reflection, it means they have a mission: to save themselves and everyone else from their own bad", "But, I haven't been able to find out clues, on what it means? To save yourself or everyone else? "  then, when they stand up and get going, their reflectios cross, where old man's good goes away and mirro's bad goes away, and the old man is like "sorry, idk what has gotten into me" and a mini game of a fight between them begins
the fight mechanics is the following: their own bodies arent moving, and their reflections are fighting, its a  regular fist fight, with punch, dodge, movement is along xy, and in the fight, you either lose and you have to restart from a checkpoint, or when you win, the reflections cross and become neutral again while dropping some item like "ball of light" but this item is going to be useless in the beginning of the game and is gonna play a huge part in the end of the game
[9:43 AM]
but then they see a writing on the light ball, but its in hexadecimal code, and they dont understand it, so the old man is like " my friend is a tech master lets go ask him" and then they go, another scene comes, and then they knock on the door and there's no answer, so then the old man is like "there must be a key somewhere, I remember he leaves his keys outside" so then comes exploration for items, however I need to think of inserting a bit more finding items here, and think of a continuation, but I think this is enough for a prototype
