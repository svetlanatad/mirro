Story


##Scenery 
The game starts in a house where our mc is standing in the hallway. Mirro proceeds to the right through the hallway and ends up in the living room


There is a crossroad connecting to the living room. If we go up we will end up in our father’s dark room, where we find our father sleeping with empty bottles all around the room. 


##UI
“It’d be better if he doesn’t wake up”., thinks Mirro

##Scenery
If we take the path below from the living room, we end up in our mother’s room, but there is no mother in there and the room corners has spider webs.


##UI
“Mother’s not here, maybe I should leave the room.

##Scenery
Our mc gets out of the room and waits in front of the room for some time, thinking, how did he end up here


##UI
"She has been missing for 14 years, it was foolish of me to hope otherwise”.


##Scenery
Mirro returns to the living room and proceeds to the right path to the basement. Here he finds the mirror that has no touch sign and a lot of warning signs hanging above it. He starts slowly approaching the mirror.


##UI
“I've never seen this object anywhere else before, and always didn’t know why Father didn’t sell it even when we had nothing to eat”.

##Scenery Mirror interaction Scene 0

After interaction: 
##Scenery

The world shakes(alternative: the game screen breaks) then black screen. Character colors change, our character only has bright colors in a gloomy mirror world, we end up in a city. We walk a little bit and find something written on the wall with blood.
##UI

 Press E to inspect.

In the wall it was written 

“I’ve been stuck in this world for over a year now, I noticed that when I first came here my body felt lighter, and it seemed like as if the negativity in me was taken out ... This is a wonderful world, although it seems prone to shattering when in contact with negative energy.”

“The handwriting seems familiar”, thinks  Mirro.

##Scenery
He continues his journey and meets an old man struggling to carry his parcel.

##UI
“Hey there young man, would you be so kind to help me out to carry the groceries?”, Old man, purple
“Sorry I can’t do that, do you know how to exit this world?”, Mirro, orange
“Why? There is no exit because no one wants to leave, isn’t it great?”, Old man, purple
"I need to get out of here somehow, I rememeber there was something next to the wall, might go check it out.

##Scenery
Next to the wall, there is an interaction item around, that is a pile of coins
Mirro needs to pickup the coin, and figure out to interact with the old grandpa

##UI
"Why are you giving this to me", Old man, purple

##Scenery, 1, TugOfWar

##UI
Snatch the parcel from the old man.

After stealing the parcel old man falls on the ground and murmurs
##UI
“Why would you do that, you foolish child, you are putting all of us here at risk”, Old man, purple

##Scenery
Mirro is in the basement as he was but now he has gloomy colors and instead of a mirror there is a doorway to outside.

##UI
“I don't know what happened, and why do I have some memories about an Old man,  it feels like there is two of me now, what the hell is happening... I probably shouldn’t have touched that thing, I need to wind out”.

##Scenery
Before leaving, Mirro finds an old newspaper on the way out. Inspect 

##UI
“They say they created the perfect mirror utopia but it has nothing to do with our reality, what good it is if it sucks off all the good things from our real world leaving  mere negative shell here, however,  the experiment was a failure. I issued an order to dispose from all mirrors before the second rise of the sun, those folks'd better get right into it”.

##Scenery
The mc goes out of the doorway, ends up in the same city, proceeds and meets the same old man.

##UI
“That’s the same person I stole the bag from, maybe I should do smth to make up for it”, Mirro, orange

“ Oh my goodness boy, what happened to you, you look like the death itself, I know having terminal cancer is not an easy thing”, Old man, purple
“I don’t have a cancer old fart, let me help you cross the road, damn", Mirro, orange
“But I don’t need to- ”, Old Man

##Scenery 3 Road Cross

#####################
##UI
“Thank you for the help but I don’t live on this street, my house was on the other side of the street....”

##Scenery 3 Road Cross
“Thank you”, Old man, purple
“You’re welcome”, Mirro, orange

"Perhaps it wasn't a good thing I did, or was it?", thinks Mirro, light orange
His outfit changed, back to the original, so it is up to the player to think wheather it was a good or bad act 

##Scenery, neutral world? 

"I should go out, clear my head a bit", thinks Mirro

In parallel mirror world, our mc is leaving and enters a club. On the entrance wall he finds another blood wall writing.

##UI
“It seems any changes done in this world doesn’t affect the real world”

“Sob sob”, Idol, pink
"This could be a good opportunity, she looks like a total mess, maybe I can make her feel worse.", Mirro, orange 
“What happened miss?”, Mirro, orange
“Well, *sob sob*, actually, everything is so bad, I saw an old man lying on the floor all beaten up, I helped him out, he told me he is a fan and his name was Stuard, but I was so focused to remember his name that I forgot why I was even outside”, Idol, pink
"Wow, she has some serious memory issues", thinks Mirro
“Then I came here for my performance and I realized that I did not recruit any backup singers for my show, this is a disaster, *sob sob*”, Idol, pink
“Well that means you are very lucky, because I happen to have a knack for singing”, Mirro, orange
“Really? You would really help me out kind  man? That’s so kind and so generous” *continues sobbing*, Idol, Pink
##Scenery
Mirro and Idol walk together, while slowly approaching the main building of Idol's performance.

##UI
"By the way, what's your name?", Mirro, orange
"My name? Well, that's not the kind of question to ask young idols, especially girls...", Idol, pink
"..." three dots indicating for silence, grey
"To be frank, I never thought I'd ever end up this way. I used to be way more organized, and, I had a lot more courage, which brought me to where I am now. However, after seeing my fans get so happy for me, during my performances, I couldn't help but wonder, that I never deserved any of their cheers", Idol, pink
"Seriously, you must think of me as a weirdo now, but, let me tell you one last thing... The happiness of my audience is what really matters to me now, aside from myself, my confidence, or even my memory. What really matters, is their feelings in their hearts ", Idol , pink
"Ooooh kaaaaay?", Mirro, orange
"That's strange, perhaps she is trying to tell me that I should do my best as her backup singer? Or, is the feelings of the audience that really matter, or her own feelings?", Mirro, orange
 

##Scenery 4, Idol, rhythm game 
##UI
"Get it right, or not right, is up to you, Idol perhaps wanted you to have fun instead", grey 
"Here, one may collect good, or bad points. If the player scores more than loses, then, player receives more good points. If player scores less than loses, player receives more bad points"

##Scenery, black screen
"You did well so far. Now, it is time to take time and ponder, what are we really doing this for?". grey
"As you can see, in this world, what we call "good" is seperated from "bad", and it is thy choice to balance it the way you want. However, you should know that the "good" thy  know might be not the one familiar to thyself.", grey
"What really Idol cared for?", grey
"What really Grandpa longed for, someone's helping hand, or, merely, someone to share a conversation with? He did try to strike up a joke, did he not?", grey

##Pause 

##Scenery 3, Idol, inside the building

"WooW, you really did do great... thank you... *sob sob*", Idol, pink
"It really wasn't a big deal", Mirro, orange-yellow

Black suited men come inside, giving them a surprise
"You should leave immediately. It is forbidden to have performances here", one of the men, black
"What? isn't it Idol's building? Who are you?", Mirro, orange
"This place is not for your playrounds. If you haven't already, ask Idol what this place is. Now, before it gets serious, leave", man, black
"I'm not going anywhere until any of you explain me what is going on?", Mirro, orange

##Scenery 5, Donkey Kong

"Player needs to reach the top, and interact with the Idol. Do not touch the barrels, one barrel is equivalent to one less hp. Try your best to find out the truth", grey


##Scenery 3, Idol, inside the building
##UI
"Will you please explain me, what was this all about, why did I have to fight through this?", Mirro, orange

"Why you fought through it, I don't know myself, but, thank you... I think, may be you have figured it out already. I am no idol, I am all pretend, and all my fans is my mere imagination.", Idol, pink

"...", grey
Pause for 2 seconds
"I don't get it...", Mirro, orange
"You see, my memory is bad as I am having trouble differentiating betweem the worlds I live in. Sometimes, it feels like this is a simulation, and inside the *mirrors* is the actual world, where I can finally find my peace. I was never able to find it, hence I created it, in my own world, in my own head... ", Idol, pik
"I figured, that if I just tried harder, people would like me more... As, all I ever wanted, was, just,...*sob sob*", idol, pink
Pause for 4 seconds
"What is it? What have you always wanted? " , Mirro, orange
##Scenery
##UI
"Explore the area, you may find the answer to what Idol longs for"
Player needs to explore and find 2 pickup items. A piece of a broken glass, and a piece of a broken mirror. 
After picking up the mirror
"Idol hated looking at herself in the Mirror, but maybe that has changed now?"

After picking up the glass
"This could remind Idol what is she afraid of"

After picking up both items
"The choice is to be made by thyself. What could really help Idol, is your choice"

- If player decides to give Idol the Mirror piece
"Thank you.... I see myself clearly here, which reminds me...", Idol, pink
"I really did lose my own peace, this makes me wonder, if I ever had one in the beginning...", Idol, Pink
"Admit it. All you ever wanted, was just acceptance of yourself, isn't it?", Mirro, orange
Pause for 3 seconds
A lot more bad points go to the player, but a bit good, 3:1 ratio
- If player deides to give Idol the Glass piece
"Thank you.... I see myself clearly here, which reminds me...", Idol, pink
"What I really needed, was, just, see myself differently, maybe I'm not so bad after all, thank you...thank you *sob sob*" Idol, pink
"Admit it. All you ever wanted, was just friends, isn't it?", Mirro, orange
"Yeah...", Idol, pink
"Will you be my friend?", Idol, pink
"I don't know. Maybe?", Mirro, pink

A lot more good  points go to the player, but a bit bad , 3:1 ratio


##Scenery, Mirro's house
"This is messed up. I need to fix this", thinks Mirro, orange
"I may find the same bar I found Idol in", thinks Mirro, orange
Heads to the same bar, finds the girl drunk partying. Approaches her

“Hey ,Idol, I am one of your fans, don’t you have a concert today?”, Mirro

 “I totaly forgot about it, thank you for the reminder. As token for my appreciation, would you like the big chance of singing along with your favorite idol?”, Idol
“You just forgot to hire a backup singer didn’t you?”, Mirro, orange

##Scenery Idol Rhythm game

"Thy have an opportunity to change the course of the story. Win the minigame if you believe you did the right thing. Lose it if you believe you did wrongso ", grey

##Scenery, Inside Mirror
Back to the mirror reality, you are in a cave where you find your family’s old watch, Interaction item.
##UI
"What is this doing here, I have exactly one like this but it is all broken and rusty, yet this one seems in a perfect condition, could it be...", Mirro, orange








The mc continues his path to the depths of the cave. He finds his father sitting there.
“Mirro, you are here as well?? Such a blessing to be able to be here with my son, isn’t this great?”
“What are you doing here I don’t understand, why are you glowing the same way I do?”
“When you were younger I was working on a prototype, for creating utopia, simulation where the world would be the perfect reflection of our reality, and people who used the device would be free from
all worldly sins, and I achieved it. But those fools feared the age of renovation, they put labels and warnings on my products and got rid of it forbidding its testing and sale to public. But I

wouldn’t have chosen my profession if I didn’t have the guts to do what I think is right to do, I tested it on myself, and here am I, in a world perfectly happy with no negative qualities left in me, with no harsh consequences from my actions, and now even the perfect version of my son is here with me”
“Do you have any idea, what have you done you prick, and you still act so entitled. You left us, and you think you deserve to live your happy life? Matter of fact as I was coming here, I was changing your fairytale reality, just like you changed ours when you left your family behind, an alcoholic deadbeat who destroyed his marriage and my childhood”
Mini game of fist fight starts.
After winning scene changes.
The mc is at his house facing his drunk father.
“I’m sorry for hating you all this time, I never knew you used the mirror on yourself, I still find it hard to forgive you, but at least now I know why you were like that”
“S....Sorry, I am a failure, both as a father and as a scientist”
“...”
“The project that I worked on, it never actually worked the way it was supposed to, it doesn’t separate your emotions Mirro, it just lifts off the consequences of your actions, whatever you do in the mirror world is whatever you wished to do anyway”
“I need to dispose of it, so that this misfortune does not happen again to anyone else”
MC heads off to the basement and finds the mirror there with his reflection standing in front of it. “We need to talk”-reflection
“I know”
“I don’t want to leave this place, this is the best I have ever felt past 14 years, although I don’t like what our father has done, I find it to be something intriguing, I am sorry but you have to hold on to the negative traits for me there”
“You are not sorry and both of us know that in a perfectly good world you won’t even be able to feel sorry, like you did not when you were committing those horrible acts”
“I had to do it to get out”
“Then finish it, get out and let’s close this whole curse of a dimension”
“...it’s not going to happen, you only want to close it because you are left with bad traits, I will stop you now and finish what our father has begun, for the ultimate good, if self sacrifice is all it takes then I’ll do it, but it won’t be my this self”
Player has to make a choice, stay in the mirror world or seal it.
If chosen to seal it the mirror reflection creates moving platforms from the ground launched at you. Minigame similar to flappy bird but with jumping mechanics begins, reach the mirror to break it. If chosen to stay in the mirror world rock dodging minigame starts.
Two endings, one of the characters die depending which one you chose.
